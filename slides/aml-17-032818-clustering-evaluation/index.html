# Evaluating Clustering

03/28/18

Andreas C. Müller
???
Last time we talked about clustering, and an obvious question is:
Which algorithm do we use, and how do we set the parameters?
That's a bit more of an art than a science, unfortunately.
But I want to give you some tools to do better than just guessing.

# Evaluation Measures
???
The fist thing I want to talk about is evaluation measures.
There's basically two types:
Supervised, where you have a ground-truth clustering,
and unsupervised, where you don't.
Let's start with the supervised methods.
---
class: spacious
#Supervised evaluation

- Compare clustering against "Ground Truth".

- Unclear what the assumptions are.

- Impossible to do in practice.

???
- Usually classification datasets.

- Often used for papers on clustering algorithms.

- Compare partitions, not labels!

Here you assume that
you are provided some "true" cluster labels that you want to compare against.
What people often do is just use a classification dataset, and basically
treat it as an unsupervised clustering problem.
This is particularly done by researchers in clustering that want to show
that their algorithm performs better than some other algorithm.
Doing this, you are measuring how well a completely unsupervised algorithm
can identify the classes in the dataset as clusters.
The problem here is that it's very unclear what kind of assumptions about
the clusters you are making with this labeling of the data.
There might be many valid ways to cluster a dataset, and it's unclear
why the class labels should somehow correspond to the "best" clustering,
or in what sense this clustering is "best".
It's very unlikely that there's a coherent definition of cluster so that
the classes correspond to clusters for any particular dataset - unless
the classes are really well separated.

The final downside is that this is actually impossible in practice, and
therefore basically completely useless. Why would you use a clustering
algorithm if you have ground truth? You'd always be better using a classification
algorithm. Even if you have very little labeled data, using this in some way
is probably still much better than trying to run a completely unsupervised
clustering algorithm.
So basically if you're running a supervised evaluation method, why are you
doing clustering at all?
This makes sense to do if you're studying clustering algorithms, but not
really in any practical application.
I still want to talk you through how these methods work.

One thing to keep in mind for all the cluster evaluation metrics is that
they compare partitions, not labellings. While clustering outcomes in 
scikit-learn (and other libraries) are always given as integers, you
don't want to compare the actual integers, as you do in supervised learning.
You want to compare the partitions given by the cluster labels.

# Thinking in Partitions

- Partition: set expressed as a union of disjoint sets.

- Y=[0, 0, 0,  1, 1, 1] → C={{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}}

- Y=[0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2] → C={{0, 2}, {1, 3}, {4, 5}}

- Partition given by [1, 0, 1, 0] and [0, 1, 0, 1] are the same!

???
Here's a small example.
Partitioning the data means expressing it as a union of disjoint sets.
So a partitioning is a sett of sets.
In this example, the labelling 0,0,0,1,1,1 means that the first three
data points are in the same cluster, and the remaining datapoints are in
a different cluster. And I wrote that down as a partition here,
using the sample indices.
Here's another example of 0,1,0,1,2,2, which means the zeroth and 2nd example
are in one set, and the first and third sample are in a different set, and the
fourth and fifth are in a different one again.

So the labels really have no semantics, and the partitions given by 0,1,0,1
and 1,0,1,0 are the same, so if you compare these two clusterings,
they should be regarded as exactly the same clustering.

# Contingency Matrix
For clusterings `$X_i$` and `$Y_j$`, `$n_{ij}=|X_i \cap Y_j|$`

`$$
\begin{array}{c|cccc|c}
    {{} \atop X}\!\diagdown\!^Y &
    Y_1&
    Y_2&
    \ldots&
    Y_s&
    \text{Sums}
    \\
    \hline
    X_1&
    n_{11}&
    n_{12}&
    \ldots&
    n_{1s}&
    a_1
    \\
    X_2&
    n_{21}&
    n_{22}&
    \ldots&
    n_{2s}&
    a_2
    \\

    \hline
    \text{Sums}&
    b_1&
    b_2&
    \ldots&
    b_s&
    \end{array}$$`
    


???
The most basic way to compare two different clustering results, say yours
and the ground truth, or two different algorithms, is the contingency matrix.
You might know contingency matrices from statistics, where they are used
to relate discrete probability distributions.
The Contingency matrix is quite similar to a confusion matrix, in that it
counts how often a datapoint was given label i in one clustering and label j
in the other clustering.
So rows correspond to one clustering, and columns correspond to the other.
However, because labels don't mean anything,
the diagonal has no meaning, and both of these contingency matrices here
mean that the two clusterings produce the same partition, i.e. they are identical.

Also, contingency matrices do not need to be square. If you run clustering
on a dataset, you don't usually know the number of clusters so you want
to compare different clusterings with different numbers of clusters.
FIXME needs example

Now that we have this basic representation of cluster overlap, we can
define derived metrics 
---
# Contingency Matrix

# Mutual Information

`$$\Large MI(U,V)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{|U|}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{|V|}P(i,j)\log\frac{P(i,j)}{P(i)P'(j)}$$`

`$$\Large =\sum\limits_{i=1}^{|U|}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{|V|}\frac{|U_i \cap V_j|}{N}
\log\frac{N|U_i \cap V_j|}{|U_i||V_j|}$$`


???
- Between 0 and 1 but not normalized or adjusted. If V is subpartition of U still = 1

A very common metric is mutual information. which is the mutual information
of the discrete distributions given by the partitions (or the contingency table).

FIXME unify notation (second equation only?)
FIXME define P(i), P(i, j)
Mutual information is a standard information theoretic measure for relating
two distributions, providing a measure of how interdependent they are.
There we just create distributions corresponding to the partitions and compare those.

We can rewrite this uing the contingency matrix, the probability P(i, j) is
just the the entry n_ij divided by the number of samples, and P(i) and P(j) are the
row and column sums divided by the number of samples.

Mutual information is also always between zero and one, with one being
perfect information. However, if one partition is a sub-partitioning of
the other partition, the mutual information is still one.

---
#NMI and AMI

`$$ NMI(U,V) = \frac{MI(U,V)}{\sqrt{H(U)H(V)}}$$`

`$$ AMI = \frac{MI - E[MI]}{\max(H(U),H(V))-E[MI]} $$`

???
Similar to the rand index, the mutual information depends on the number
of samples and size of the clusters, and it's common to adjust it for chance,
to give it a more universal scale.
Two common normalizations are the normalized mutual information NMI, which divides the mutual information
by the squareroot of the products of the entropy of the marginal distributions,
and the adjusted mutual information AMI, which has an adjustment for chance.
FIXME definition of entropy?

Both use the entropy to penalize overpartitioning, but only AMI is adjusted for chance,
so zero on expecation.
These two usually behave pretty similarly. There is other variants of NMI,
for example dividing by the maximum, as I did here for AMI.


- Penalizes overpartitioning (via entropy)
- Adjusts for chance – any two random partitions have
expected AMI of 0
FIXME definition of entropy?
FIXME use max both times?
FIXME explain expectation better!
---
# Rand Index

- Computed of partitions U, V over the same elements (say {0, …, n-1})

`$$ R(U, V) = \frac{r+s}{\binom{n}{2}}  $$`

- $r$ :  Number of pairs of points in the same set in U and in V

- $s$ : Number of pairs of points in the different sets in U and in V

- $\binom{n}{2}$ : Number of possible pairs

- Between 0 and 1
???
One of the most useful one is the Rand Index.
For two partitions C1 and C2, it computes the number of pairs points that are in
the same set in C1 and in the same set in C2, called "a" here, and the number of pairs of
points that are in different sets in both C1 and C2, called "b" here.
This is divided by n choose 2, so the number of all possible pairs of points.
This is always between zero and one, though the actual possible minimum and
maximum depend on the number of clusters and the number of points.

Let's do an example. We're comparing the labeling 0011 and the labelling 1100.
They are the same, so hopefully the rand index is going to be 1.
First, I write these as partitions here. Then I check which pairs of points
are in the same set in both partitions. The pair 0,1 is in the same set
in both partitions, so we count that. The pair 2,3 is also in the same set
in both partitions, so we count that as well. No other pairs are in the same
set in either partition, so we're done counting for "a".
Now we count the pairs of points that are in different sets. Zero and 2 are in
different sets in partition one, and also in different sets in partition 2.
Same for zero and 3, and 1 and 2, and 1 and 3. So that's four pairs in total.
So the nummerator is 2 + 4 = 6. The denominator is 4 choose 2, which is also six,
so the rand index is 1, as expected.

For a second example, let's look at these two partitions, 0,1,0,1 and 1,2,0,0.
Here there's no pair of points that is in the same set in both of them.
There are three pairs of points that are in different sets in both of them,
(1,2), (2,3) and (0,3). So the rand index is 3/6, so 1/2.

Alright, so the rand index is about matching pairs of points, which is slightly
tricky to do in your head, but not that complicated really.
---
# Rand Index Example

`$$R([0,0,1,1],[1,1,0,0]) = R\left(\{\{0,1\},\{2,3\}\},\{\{0,1\},\{2,3\}\} \right)$$`
`$$ = \frac{2+4}{6} = 1 $$`

`$$R([0,1,0,1],[0,0,1,2]) = R(\{\{0,2\},\{1,3\}\},\{\{0,1\},\{2\},\{3\}\})$$`
`$$ = \frac{0+3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} $$`

???
---
# Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)

`$$ AdjustedIndex = \frac{\text{Index}-\text{ExpectedIndex}}{\text{MaxIndex}-\text{ExpectedIndex}}$$`

`$$ARI = \frac{\sum_{ij}\binom{n_{ij}}{2} - \frac{\sum_{i}\binom{a_{i}}{2}\sum_{j}\binom{b_{j}}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}}}
{\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{i}\binom{a_{i}}{2} + \sum_{j}\binom{b_{j}}{2}\right) -\frac{\sum_{i}\binom{a_{i}}{2} + \sum_{j}\binom{b_{j}}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}}}$$`


???
- Maximum of 1, 0 on expectation (can become negative!)
[Don’t learn the formula]

Because the range of the rand index depends on the data, in practice people prefer
to use the adjusted rand index, which is adjusted for chance. So we take the
index we just computed, subtract the expected index over this dataset, and divide
it by the maximum index on this dataset minus the expected index.
This means the expectation over all cluster assignments is zero, and the maximum
over cluster assignments is 1. However, it means the adjusted rand index
can become negative, basically if the partitions are less similar than they
would be on expectation, or by chance.
What this works out to is this nice formula here. The n_ij is the entries of
the continency table we saw before, and the a_i and b_i are the row and columns
sums of that contingency table.
I really don't wanna remember that formula, so don't worry, it's not gonna
be on the test. Just keep in mind that it measures exactly the same thing
as the rand index, only adjusting for chance.
You can see all of the normalization terms only depend on the row and column
sums, so the number of samples in each of the clusters. Only this first part here
depends on the contingency table.
The most common use of this is to compare a particular clustering to a ground-truth
clustering.
